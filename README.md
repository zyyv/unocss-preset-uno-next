# UnoCSS Align with TailwindV4

This is a proof-of-concept repository, but it is also the direction I am working on. Due to the massive disruptive changes in [`TailwindCSS`  `V4`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta), I decided to align `UnoCSS` with `TailwindCSS` `V4`. This is a huge project, but I will do my best.
